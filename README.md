# Huffman_Coding
 
We will be implementing a Huffman code.

Things to do in the code: 
1. Go to http://www.gutenberg.org and find a book in English. Download the book as a plain text (.txt)
file using a Plain Text UTF-8 link.

2. Calculate the frequency of each letter/symbol in the text.

3. Create the Huffman tree based on 128 ASCII characters (https://ascii.cl/). You can ignore the first 32 characters (with codes 0-31), so the total number of characters would be 96.

4. Print a table with your code, e.g:
    •a: 0010
    •b: 0011
    •c: 11111
    •. . .

5. Compare the savings of your code with a fixed-length encoding using 7 bits per character. How many
bits did you save?
